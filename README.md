## Budget Dashboard Project
## Description

The Budget Dashboard project is a React-based web application designed to visualize and manage budget allocations across various categories such as Housing, Food, Utilities, and more. It leverages interactive Pie and Bar charts to provide insights into current spending against predefined budget thresholds.
Motivation

This project was selected to deepen understanding of React and D3.js for creating dynamic, data-driven visualizations. The aim was to learn how to efficiently render and update charts based on user interactions and data changes, reflecting real-world scenarios in budget management applications. By completing this project, I hoped to enhance my skills in state management in React and integrating D3.js for complex visualizations, achieving a practical understanding of these technologies in the context of a financial application.
Major Themes

    React for UI Development: Utilized React's component-based architecture to manage the application's UI, allowing for a modular, maintainable codebase. React's state management was crucial for handling user interactions and data updates, ensuring the UI stays responsive and up-to-date.

    Data Visualization with D3.js: Integrated D3.js for rendering Pie and Bar charts, demonstrating its powerful capabilities in translating raw data into meaningful visual representations. This theme underlines the importance of effective data visualization techniques in conveying information intuitively to users.

## Reflections on Improvements

If given the opportunity to redo this project, I would focus more on optimizing the data processing logic to enhance performance, especially when dealing with large datasets. Additionally, exploring more advanced state management solutions, like Redux or Context API, could provide cleaner state handling across components. Implementing responsive design principles to ensure the dashboard looks and functions well on various devices would also be a priority.

## Things I Can Improve On:

- Making the app more responsive.
- Dropdowns are disabled because they are not fully implemented.
- Update code to allow the bar graph to be dynamic, so that when a user updates values, it changes as well.
- Including more graphs to compare personal spending with public spending data.
- Add percentages to the pie chart.

## Running the Project

### To run the Budget Dashboard:

  - Go to website: https://dan1423.github.io/simple-budget-app/
  - You can change the amount on each row, and the pie chart changes in real time
  - Unfortunately, The bar graph is static because I did not have enough time
